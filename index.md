Hi! My name is Rachel Hardy. I am 25 years old and a **first-year** graduate student of Statistics at NC State University. This blog will be used for one of my **current** classes: *ST 558*! ðŸ˜„

A little about me:
1. I enjoy playing tennis, riding bikes, and doing Pilates.
2. My favorite thing to do is go to the movies!
3. I have a fraternal twin named Olivia.
