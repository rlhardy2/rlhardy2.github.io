## Project 3 Blog Post!

Prompt:

Once youâ€™ve completed the project each of you should write a brief blog post outlining your project and two
links to the username.github.io/repo-name site and the repo itself (the username may correspond to your
partner). You should then also reflect on the process you went through. Discuss the following:

* What would you do differently?
* What was the most difficult part for you?
* What are your big take-aways from this project?
