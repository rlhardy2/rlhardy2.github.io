## Project 3 Blog Post!

Prompt:

Once youâ€™ve completed the project each of you should write a brief blog post outlining your project and two
links to the username.github.io/repo-name site and the repo itself (the username may correspond to your
partner). You should then also reflect on the process you went through. Discuss the following:

* What would you do differently?
* What was the most difficult part for you?
* What are your big take-aways from this project?

To be completely honest, my partner and I handled this project pretty well. I'm not sure if there's much I'd do differently in the future besides maybe just trying to start earlier.
The most difficult part for me (and my partner) was the automation! We struggled with that a lot, though the rest of the project was pretty doable. 
My big takeaways from this project are:

* Learning and seeing how to put together multiple analyses, which will be helpful with a corporate job. 
* Learning how to do the automation and how it works. 
* Learning how to deal with data in the form of doing a small EDA as well as try to fit multiple models. 
* How to write descriptive code that changes depending on the analysis that's being performed.
